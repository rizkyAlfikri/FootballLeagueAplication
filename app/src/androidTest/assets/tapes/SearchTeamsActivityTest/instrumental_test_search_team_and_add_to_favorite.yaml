      Premier League (often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL) outside England), is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League
      (EFL).\r\n\r\nThe Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
      The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border league.\r\n\r\nThe competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First
      Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast
      116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights. In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion, rising sharply to £2.4 billion in 2016–17.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League
      is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. In the 2014–15 season, the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000, second highest of any
      professional football league behind the Bundesliga''s 43,500. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, as
      of 2018.\r\n\r\nForty-nine clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. Six of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Manchester City (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), and Leicester City (1). Following
      the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became, and still remain, the only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game. The record of most points in a season is 100 by Manchester City in
      2017–18.","strDescriptionDE":"Die Premier League (offiziell nach dem Sponsoren „Barclays Premier League“, umgangssprachlich „The Premiership“) ist die höchste Spielklasse im englischen Fußball und befindet sich damit auf der obersten Ebene des englischen

      Women''s Premier League National Division“), wobei die Vereine dort in mehr oder weniger abhängigen Verbindungen zu den renommierten Klubs im Männerfußball aus der Premier League und der Football League stehen. Dennoch besitzt die Frauenliga einen eher
      semiprofessionellen Charakter und findet in der Öffentlichkeit im Vergleich zum Männerbereich eine deutlich geringere Resonanz.\r\n\r\nSeit 1999 existiert zudem für die Reserveteams der Profivereine die Premier Reserve League, in der seit der Spielzeit

      Court, known as the Goldsands Stadium for sponsorship purposes, is a football stadium in Bournemouth, England and the home ground of A.F.C. Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Boscombe F.C. was given a piece of land by the town''s Cooper-Dean family, after whom
      the ground was named. The land was the site of an old gravel pit, and the ground was not built in time for the start of the 1910\u201311 season. As a result, the club played at the adjacent King''s Park until moving into Dean Court in December 1910. However,
      the club facilities were still not ready, and players initially had to change in a nearby hotel. Early developments at the ground included a 300-seat stand.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 the club were elected to Division Three South of the Football League, at which point
      they changed their name to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. The first Football League match was played at Dean Court on 1 September 1923, with 7,000 watching a 0\u20130 draw with Swindon Town. Subsequent ground improvements were made following the purcase
      of fittings from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which allowed the construction of a 3,700-seat stand. A covered terrace was added at the southern end of the ground in 1936.\r\n\r\nThe club''s record League attendance was set on 14 April 1948,
      when 25,495 watched a 1\u20130 defeat to QPR. The overall record attendance was set on 2 March 1957, when 28,799 spectators watched an FA Cup match against Manchester United. Shortly afterwards, a roof was added to the western stand. The club also purchased
      more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure
      was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site. The club''s lowest Football League attendance was set on 4 March 1986, when only 1,873 saw a 2\u20132 drawn with Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe ground was completely rebuilt in 2001, with the pitch
      rotated ninety degrees from its original position and the ground moved away from adjacent housing. Because the work was not finished in time for the start of the 2001\u201302 season, Bournemouth played their first eight games at the Avenue Stadium in nearby
      Dorchester. When Dean Court reopened with a game against Wrexham on 10 November, it gained its first sponsored name, becoming the Fitness First Stadium. Although it was rebuilt as a three sided stadium with a capacity of 9,600, seats were placed on the
      undeveloped south end in the autumn of 2005. On 24 February 2004 Bournemouth''s James Hayter scored the Football League''s fastest-ever hat-trick at Dean Court, scoring three goals in 2 minutes and 20 seconds during a 6\u20130 against Wrexham. The club
      sold the stadium in December 2005 in a sale-and-leaseback deal with London property company Structadene.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010\u201311 a temporary south stand was built, but was removed during the 2011\u201312 season after attendances fell. In July 2011 the
      stadium was renamed the Seward Stadium after the naming rights were sold to the Seward Motor Group. Following Seward entering administration in February 2012, the ground was subsequently renamed the Goldsands Stadium in a two-year deal. During the summer
      of 2013 a 2,400 seat stand was built on the undeveloped end of the ground as a result of the club''s promotion to the Championship. In July 2013 it was named after former club striker Ted MacDougall.","strStadiumLocation":"Bournemouth Dorset, England","intStadiumCapacity":"11464","strWebsite":"www.afcb.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/afcbournemouth\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/afcbournemouth","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/officialafcb","strDescriptionEN":"A.F.C.
      Bournemouth is a football club playing in the Championship, the second tier in the English football league system. The club plays at Dean Court in Kings Park, Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset and have been in existence since 1899.\r\n\r\nNicknamed The Cherries,
      the team traditionally played in red shirts with white sleeves until 1971, when the strip was changed to red and black stripes, similar to that of A.C. Milan. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons before announcing
      a return to the stripes for the 2006\u201307 season due to fan demand.\r\n\r\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League in the 2008\u201309 season, Bournemouth were promoted to League One at the end of the 2009\u201310. After making the
      League One play-off semi-finals in 2010\u201311 and achieving a mid-table finish in 2011\u201312, Bournemouth won promotion to the Championship at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, putting them in the second tier of the league for only the second time
      in their history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact date of the club''s foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John''s Lads\u2019 Institute F.C. The club was originally known
      as Boscombe F.C.. The first President was Mr. J.C. Nutt.\r\n\r\nIn their first season 1889\u201390 Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons they played
      on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season the team played on a pitch in King''s Park. In the season of 1905\u201306 Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the club was granted a long lease
      upon some wasteland next to Kings Park, as the clubs football ground, by their president Mr. J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910
      the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton.\r\n\r\nAround about this time the club obtained their nickname ''The Cherries''. Foremost there are two tales on how the club gained this pet name. First, because of the cherry-red striped

      Moor is a football stadium in Burnley, Lancashire, England. It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named
      so after the club''s longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players'' tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for
      the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the \"Star\" stand was erected
      and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces
      were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883,
      losing 3\u20136 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground
      took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf
      Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship
      fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing \u00a320 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field
      Stand and the moving of the players'' entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley''s promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced.
      Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club''s relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAfter
      again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand
      for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.","strStadiumLocation":"Harry Potts Way, Burnley,

      Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football.
      The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this
      was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club''s initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and
      played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four
      seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching
      the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with
      claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between
      1989\u201391 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990\u20131991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992,
      but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation
      at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1\u20130 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May
      2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have
      played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion,
      with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club''s kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current
      player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club''s longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club''s top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively.
      The highest transfer fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rytxyw1448813222.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133632-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/woip371509012248.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/svsvqv1424367005.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3trd0z1547482101.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/yvuwup1424367035.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ryuspy1424367053.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vpvqyu1424562192.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWB9N0012fG6bGyj486Qxmg","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133615","idSoccerXML":"20","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Everton","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"The

      area served by regular rail and bus services two miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre.\r\n\r\nGoodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 39,572. Everton fans refer to the stadium as \"The Grand

      Lane is a football stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is the home of Sheffield United. As the largest stadium in Sheffield during the 19th century it hosted most of the city''s most significant matches including the final of the world''s
      first football tournament, first floodlit match and several matches between the Sheffield and London Football Associations that led to the unification of their respective rules. It was also used by Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield F.C. for major matches.
      It has been the home of Sheffield United since the club''s establishment in 1889. It is the oldest major stadium in the world still to be hosting professional association football matches.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built on a Sheffield road named after the
      Bramall family (who were file and graver manufacturers). The Bramalls owned \"The Old White House\" on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street, and subsequently built the Sheaf House, now a public house that still stands at the top of Bramall Lane.
      The stadium was originally opened as a cricket ground. It was also used for football games in the 19th century by Sheffield F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday but since 1889 it has been the home of Sheffield United.\r\n\r\nBramall Lane is one of only two grounds
      (the other being the Oval) which has hosted England football internationals (five games prior to 1930), an England cricket test match in 1902 against Australia and a FA Cup Final Replay in 1912, when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion, 1\u20130. It also

      London).\r\nSince the 1980s, when Southampton regularly challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the
      old stadium''s cramped location which made it unsuitable for major expansion work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton''s directors initially
      decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and
      survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance
      to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.\r\n\r\nThe move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary''s Church, as the football
      team of St. Mary''s Church Young Men''s Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary''s F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and
      improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of \u00a332 million.\r\n\r\nThe Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators \u2013 less than half
      the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4\u20133.\r\n\r\nThe first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3\u20131

      was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960\u201361 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition
      \u2013 the European Cup Winners'' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two
      different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant
      that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades \u2013 an achievement only matched by Manchester United.\r\n\r\nThe club''s Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: \"To Dare Is to Do\"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football.

      situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled ''Let''s Buy Back The Vic'' with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert
      held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004.","strStadiumLocation":"Watford, Hertfordshire","intStadiumCapacity":"21577","strWebsite":"www.watfordfc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/watfordfc\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/watfordfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/watfordfcofficial","strDescriptionEN":"Watford
      Football Club is a football club based in Hertfordshire, England. Founded in 1881 as Watford Rovers, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886, and the Southern League a decade later. After finishing the 1914\u201315 season as Southern League
      champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The club played at several grounds in its early history, before moving to a permanent location at Vicarage Road in 1922, where it remains to this day. Watford spent
      most of the following half century in the lower divisions of The Football League, changing colours and crest on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nEngland manager Graham Taylor saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylor''s appointment in 1977 and departure
      in 1987, Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team finished second in the First Division in the 1982\u201383 season, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983\u201384, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final. Watford experienced a decade
      of decline between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League. The club''s most recent stint in the top division of English football was during
      the 2006\u201307 season, under Aidy Boothroyd''s management. In the 2014\u201315 season, Watford will compete in the Football League Championship \u2013 the second highest level of English football.\r\n\r\nWatford is currently owned by the Pozzo family,
      which also owns Udinese Calcio in Italy and Granada CF in Spain. Sir Elton John, who owned Watford during both of Graham Taylor''s successful periods as manager, served alongside Taylor as the club''s joint Honorary Life President, until 2008  only to
      later resume the role which he now shares alongside Graham Taylor.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rsuswy1448813519.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133624-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/bpt0h61549381309.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/2v1wyv1504211409.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/22o4v81504211424.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3lgh4y1504211456.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/pwcdb51504211469.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wkqog41504211483.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCptKljTrbdMTgmuekGKhRug","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133636","idSoccerXML":"43","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"West

      (10 km) east of central London. It was originally constructed for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics\u2014serving as the track and field venue, and as the site of their opening and closing ceremonies. Following the Games, the stadium
      was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium, with its primary tenant becoming West Ham United F.C.\r\n\r\nLand preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first
      public event in March 2012, serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham
      United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.\r\n\r\nThe stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and
      2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year). The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 80,000 spectators, and, due to its oval shape and relocatable seating, was deemed to
      potentially be suitable for other sporting events such as baseball and cricket.","strStadiumLocation":"Green Street, Upton Park, London","intStadiumCapacity":"60000","strWebsite":"www.whufc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/westhamunitedofficial","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/whufc_official","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/westham","strDescriptionEN":"West

      FA Cup twice more between 1949 and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves \"Champions of the World\" following their victories against numerous top European and World sides

      lifted again six years later under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club''s very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham
      Turner and record goalscorer Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qwvuqy1448811552.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133599-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/wdes121532295945.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/p2xn8q1532295468.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kzx8521532295383.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3zzmow1532295430.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/co1ppu1532295499.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vyxrss1462380950.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialwolvesvideo","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      Trafford in 1910. They are regarded as one of the most successful clubs in English football.\r\n\r\nManchester United have won the most League titles (20) of any English club, a joint record 11 FA Cups, four League Cups, and a record 20 FA Community Shields.
      The club has also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners'' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club won a continental treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.\r\n\r\nThe
      1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours, and 38 in total, from November
      1986 to May 2013, when he announced his retirement after 26 years at the club. On 19 May 2014, Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club''s new manager after Ferguson''s successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge, with the club''s record
      appearance-maker, Ryan Giggs, appointed as his assistant after a brief period as caretaker manager.\r\n\r\nManchester United is the third-richest football club in the world for 2011–12 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of €395.9 million, and
      the world''s second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May
      2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El
      Manchester United Football Club, mejor conocido como Manchester United, es un club de fútbol de la ciudad de Mánchester, Inglaterra, Reino Unido, que disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Old Trafford.\r\n\r\nNació bajo la denominación «Newton
      Heath LYR Football Club» en 1878, siendo el equipo del depósito ferroviario Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, ubicado en Newton Heath. El club se incorporó a la First Division en 1892. Tras estar cerca de la bancarrota en 1902, J. H. Davies tomó
      las riendas del club y cambió el nombre, llamándolo Manchester United. Su estadio fue bombardeado durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial lo que motivó al club a buscar la caridad de sus vecinos del Manchester City, quienes les permitieron jugar en Maine Road
      durante un tiempo a cambio de un costo anual. El United nombró a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su política, por entonces inaudita, de la promoción de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran éxito,
      al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este éxito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre aéreo de Múnich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y ganó la liga en 1965 y
      1967, así como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un éxito tan notable hasta la década de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigió al equipo a la obtención de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once años. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirtió en
      el primer equipo inglés en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada —el «triplete» del club—.12\r\n\r\nEntre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division\/Premier League en 20 ocasiones,
      la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, récords absolutos en los tres casos, además de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en séptimo lugar y segundo mejor
      inglés, además de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el único club inglés en convertirse en campeón mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de América
      Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nLos principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.\r\n\r\nEn la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los más populares
      del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, según una investigación realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asiático, 173 millones del Oriente Medio
      y África, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de América. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia más alto en el fútbol inglés desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17\r\n\r\nFinancieramente,

      is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United F.C. With a capacity of 75,635, Old Trafford is the second-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom after Wembley Stadium, and the ninth-largest
      in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram station.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford, nicknamed the Theatre of Dreams by Bobby Charlton, has been United''s home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949, as a
      result of bomb damage during the Second World War, the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands,
      which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000. The stadium''s record attendance was recorded
      in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford has hosted FA Cup semi-finals, England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League
      Final, as well as rugby league''s annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups. It also hosted football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women''s international football for the first time in its history.","strStadiumLocation":"Trafford,

      Football Club is an English professional football club, based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester that plays in the Premier League. Founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, the club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to Old
      Trafford in 1910. They are regarded as one of the most successful clubs in English football.\r\n\r\nManchester United have won the most League titles (20) of any English club, a joint record 11 FA Cups, four League Cups, and a record 20 FA Community Shields.
      The club has also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners'' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club won a continental treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.\r\n\r\nThe
      1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours, and 38 in total, from November
      1986 to May 2013, when he announced his retirement after 26 years at the club. On 19 May 2014, Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club''s new manager after Ferguson''s successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge, with the club''s record
      appearance-maker, Ryan Giggs, appointed as his assistant after a brief period as caretaker manager.\r\n\r\nManchester United is the third-richest football club in the world for 2011–12 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of €395.9 million, and
      the world''s second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May
      2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El
      Manchester United Football Club, mejor conocido como Manchester United, es un club de fútbol de la ciudad de Mánchester, Inglaterra, Reino Unido, que disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Old Trafford.\r\n\r\nNació bajo la denominación «Newton
      Heath LYR Football Club» en 1878, siendo el equipo del depósito ferroviario Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, ubicado en Newton Heath. El club se incorporó a la First Division en 1892. Tras estar cerca de la bancarrota en 1902, J. H. Davies tomó
      las riendas del club y cambió el nombre, llamándolo Manchester United. Su estadio fue bombardeado durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial lo que motivó al club a buscar la caridad de sus vecinos del Manchester City, quienes les permitieron jugar en Maine Road
      durante un tiempo a cambio de un costo anual. El United nombró a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su política, por entonces inaudita, de la promoción de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran éxito,
      al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este éxito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre aéreo de Múnich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y ganó la liga en 1965 y
      1967, así como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un éxito tan notable hasta la década de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigió al equipo a la obtención de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once años. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirtió en
      el primer equipo inglés en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada —el «triplete» del club—.12\r\n\r\nEntre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division\/Premier League en 20 ocasiones,
      la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, récords absolutos en los tres casos, además de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en séptimo lugar y segundo mejor
      inglés, además de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el único club inglés en convertirse en campeón mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de América
      Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nLos principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.\r\n\r\nEn la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los más populares
      del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, según una investigación realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asiático, 173 millones del Oriente Medio
      y África, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de América. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia más alto en el fútbol inglés desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17\r\n\r\nFinancieramente,
      el United se convirtió en el primer equipo deportivo en superar un valor de 3 000 millones USD, para ser catalogada de esta forma como la franquicia deportiva mejor valuada del mundo, de acuerdo a la revista Forbes, un hito que sería superado un par de
      meses después por el también club de fútbol Real Madrid, con un valor de 3 300 millones USD.

      and Hove Albion Football Club \/ˈbraɪtən ən ˈhoʊv\/ is an English football club based in the coastal city of Brighton & Hove, East Sussex. It is often referred to just as Brighton. They currently play in the Football League Championship, the second tier
      of the English football league system.\r\n\r\nThe team is nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"Albion\". The team has historically played in blue and white stripes, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain blue during the club''s
      most successful spell in the 1980s. Crystal Palace is considered the club''s main rival, although the grounds are 40 miles apart.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1901, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League before being elected to the
      Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the top division in the same
      season. Mismanagement brought Brighton close to relegation from the Football League to the Conference which they narrowly avoided in 1997 and 1998. A boardroom takeover saved Brighton from liquidation, and following successive promotions they returned
      to the second tier of English football in 2002 and have played in the second and third tiers ever since.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/ywypts1448810904.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133619-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/xvvqxv1448810981.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/bk2b6j1504211012.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/2f41gp1504211039.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/bfasc71504211054.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/nfo32o1504211067.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/5jitnu1504211082.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialbhafc","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      stadium in Bournemouth, England and the home ground of A.F.C. Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Boscombe F.C. was given a piece of land by the town''s Cooper-Dean family, after whom the ground was named. The land was the site of an old gravel pit, and the ground
      was not built in time for the start of the 1910–11 season. As a result, the club played at the adjacent King''s Park until moving into Dean Court in December 1910. However, the club facilities were still not ready, and players initially had to change in
      a nearby hotel. Early developments at the ground included a 300-seat stand.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 the club were elected to Division Three South of the Football League, at which point they changed their name to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. The first Football
      League match was played at Dean Court on 1 September 1923, with 7,000 watching a 0–0 draw with Swindon Town. Subsequent ground improvements were made following the purcase of fittings from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which allowed the construction
      of a 3,700-seat stand. A covered terrace was added at the southern end of the ground in 1936.\r\n\r\nThe club''s record League attendance was set on 14 April 1948, when 25,495 watched a 1–0 defeat to QPR. The overall record attendance was set on 2 March
      1957, when 28,799 spectators watched an FA Cup match against Manchester United. Shortly afterwards, a roof was added to the western stand. The club also purchased more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand
      and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site. The club''s lowest Football
      League attendance was set on 4 March 1986, when only 1,873 saw a 2–2 drawn with Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe ground was completely rebuilt in 2001, with the pitch rotated ninety degrees from its original position and the ground moved away from adjacent housing.
      Because the work was not finished in time for the start of the 2001–02 season, Bournemouth played their first eight games at the Avenue Stadium in nearby Dorchester. When Dean Court reopened with a game against Wrexham on 10 November, it gained its first
      sponsored name, becoming the Fitness First Stadium. Although it was rebuilt as a three sided stadium with a capacity of 9,600, seats were placed on the undeveloped south end in the autumn of 2005. On 24 February 2004 Bournemouth''s James Hayter scored
      the Football League''s fastest-ever hat-trick at Dean Court, scoring three goals in 2 minutes and 20 seconds during a 6–0 against Wrexham. The club sold the stadium in December 2005 in a sale-and-leaseback deal with London property company Structadene.\r\n\r\nIn
      the 2010–11 a temporary south stand was built, but was removed during the 2011–12 season after attendances fell. In July 2011 the stadium was renamed the Seward Stadium after the naming rights were sold to the Seward Motor Group. Following Seward entering
      administration in February 2012, the ground was subsequently renamed the Goldsands Stadium in a two-year deal. During the summer of 2013 a 2,400 seat stand was built on the undeveloped end of the ground as a result of the club''s promotion to the Championship.
      In July 2013 it was named after former club striker Ted MacDougall.","strStadiumLocation":"Bournemouth Dorset, England","intStadiumCapacity":"11464","strWebsite":"www.afcb.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/afcbournemouth\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/afcbournemouth","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/officialafcb","strDescriptionEN":"A.F.C.
      Bournemouth is a football club playing in the Championship, the second tier in the English football league system. The club plays at Dean Court in Kings Park, Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset and have been in existence since 1899.\r\n\r\nNicknamed The Cherries,
      the team traditionally played in red shirts with white sleeves until 1971, when the strip was changed to red and black stripes, similar to that of A.C. Milan. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons before announcing a
      return to the stripes for the 2006–07 season due to fan demand.\r\n\r\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League in the 2008–09 season, Bournemouth were promoted to League One at the end of the 2009–10. After making the League One play-off
      semi-finals in 2010–11 and achieving a mid-table finish in 2011–12, Bournemouth won promotion to the Championship at the end of the 2012–13 season, putting them in the second tier of the league for only the second time in their history.\r\n\r\nAlthough
      the exact date of the club''s foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John''s Lads’ Institute F.C. The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C.. The first President
      was Mr. J.C. Nutt.\r\n\r\nIn their first season 1889–90 Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown.
      From their third season the team played on a pitch in King''s Park. In the season of 1905–06 Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park, as the clubs football
      ground, by their president Mr. J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910 the club signed their first professional football player B.
      Penton.\r\n\r\nAround about this time the club obtained their nickname ''The Cherries''. Foremost there are two tales on how the club gained this pet name. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps more plausible,
      because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which encompassed numerous cherry orchards.\r\n\r\nFor the first time during the season of 1913–14 the club competed in the F.A. Cup. The clubs progress was halted in 1914 with the outbreak
      of the war and Boscombe F.C. returned to the Hampshire league.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Third Division was formed and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, with moderate success.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/y08nak1534071116.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/aaonqz1510842509.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/yttutv1448813203.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wvuypx1469485789.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/sxrxwp1469485821.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uqqwvw1469485695.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uwryss1469485747.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/sxypup1469486566.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officiacherries","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      Games, it was agreed in 1998 that Manchester City F.C. would lease the stadium from Manchester City Council as a replacement for Maine Road. The conversion from a track and field arena to a football stadium cost the city council £22 million and Manchester

      City Football Club is a football club in Manchester, England. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark''s (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club''s home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east
      Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.\r\n\r\nManchester City first played in the top-tier of the Football League in 1899 and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. The club''s most successful period
      was from 1968 to 1970, when it won the League Championship, FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners'' Cup, under the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating
      in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, Manchester City was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million, receiving considerable
      investment. The club went on to win the Premier League in 2012, 2014, and 2018.\r\n\r\nManchester City has the fifth-highest revenue in football, at €527.7 million in 2016–17. Forbes magazine ranks it as the world''s fifth-most valuable football club,

      Stadium in Manchester, England, also known as Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is the home ground of Manchester City Football Club. For the 2014\/15 football season, the stadium has a reduced capacity of 45,500 due to expansion work. Capacity will
      increase to 62,000 from August 2015 making it the second-largest stadium in the Premier League and the ninth-largest in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe SportCity location, but with a larger stadium, had been proposed for the main athletics arena in Manchester''s
      failed bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. In the 2002 Commonwealth Games bid, the capacity for the Games was to be 38,000, and after the games it would be converted to be 48,000. The stadium was built by Laing Construction at a cost of £112 million and
      was designed and engineered by ArupSport. The design incorporated a highly complex yet elegant cable-stayed roof structure which is suspended by twelve exterior masts and attached cables.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the long-term future of the stadium after the Commonwealth
      Games, it was agreed in 1998 that Manchester City F.C. would lease the stadium from Manchester City Council as a replacement for Maine Road. The conversion from a track and field arena to a football stadium cost the city council £22 million and Manchester
      City £20 million The club moved into its new home during the summer of 2003.\r\n\r\nIn addition to athletics, the stadium has hosted the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, England football internationals, rugby league matches, boxing world title fights and music concerts,
      and will host one 2015 Rugby World Cup match.\r\n\r\nIn March 2014 work commenced on expansion with the south stand roof partially removed over the summer to allow construction to take place. The work is due to be completed by the beginning of the 2015\/16
      football season with capacity increasing to over 55,000. The expansion will coincide with development immediately adjacent to the stadium and the completion of the Etihad Campus training facility, Connell Sixth Form College and community hub which is partly

      in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, Manchester City was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million, receiving considerable

      has been the home of an English Premier league club, Southampton F.C. since 2001. The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the South of England (excluding London).\r\nSince the 1980s, when Southampton regularly
      challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the old stadium''s cramped location which made it unsuitable
      for major expansion work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton''s directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium
      (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.\r\n\r\nAfter
      a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the
      heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.\r\n\r\nThe move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary''s Church, as the football team of St. Mary''s Church Young Men''s Association
      before becoming Southampton St. Mary''s F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total
      of £32 million.\r\n\r\nThe Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators – less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on
      1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4–3.\r\n\r\nThe first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3–1 victory over Havant & Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final
      on 1 May 2002.","strStadiumLocation":"Britannia Rd, Southampton, England","intStadiumCapacity":"32505","strWebsite":"www.saintsfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/southamptonfc","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/southamptonfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/southamptonfc","strDescriptionEN":"Southampton

      since generally played in red and white shirts.\r\n\r\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with Portsmouth due to its close proximity and both cities'' respective maritime history. Matches between the two sides are known as the South Coast Derby.\r\n\r\nThe
      club has won the FA Cup once in 1976, and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in 1983–84. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005 ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club.

      Park is a football stadium in the district of Witton, Birmingham, England, with a seating capacity of 42,682. It has been the home of Aston Villa Football Club since 1897. The team previously played at Aston Park from 1874 to 1876 and Wellington Road from
      1876 to 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both Witton and Aston railway stations and has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It was the first English ground to stage international
      football in three different centuries. Villa Park has hosted more FA Cup semi-finals than any other stadium, having hosted 55 matches in total.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park
      situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road
      Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.\r\n\r\nBefore 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter
      of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league
      and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners'' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was unavailable due to it staging the final of the Olympic football tournament.","strStadiumLocation":"Aston,
