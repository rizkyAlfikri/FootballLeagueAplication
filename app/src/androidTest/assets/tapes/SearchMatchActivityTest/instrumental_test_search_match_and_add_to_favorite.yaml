      Premier League (often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL) outside England), is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League
      (EFL).\r\n\r\nThe Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
      The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border league.\r\n\r\nThe competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First
      Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast
      116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights. In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion, rising sharply to £2.4 billion in 2016–17.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League
      is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. In the 2014–15 season, the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000, second highest of any
      professional football league behind the Bundesliga''s 43,500. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, as
      of 2018.\r\n\r\nForty-nine clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. Six of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Manchester City (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), and Leicester City (1). Following
      the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became, and still remain, the only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game. The record of most points in a season is 100 by Manchester City in
      2017–18.","strDescriptionDE":"Die Premier League (offiziell nach dem Sponsoren „Barclays Premier League“, umgangssprachlich „The Premiership“) ist die höchste Spielklasse im englischen Fußball und befindet sich damit auf der obersten Ebene des englischen

      Women''s Premier League National Division“), wobei die Vereine dort in mehr oder weniger abhängigen Verbindungen zu den renommierten Klubs im Männerfußball aus der Premier League und der Football League stehen. Dennoch besitzt die Frauenliga einen eher
      semiprofessionellen Charakter und findet in der Öffentlichkeit im Vergleich zum Männerbereich eine deutlich geringere Resonanz.\r\n\r\nSeit 1999 existiert zudem für die Reserveteams der Profivereine die Premier Reserve League, in der seit der Spielzeit

      na Hillsborough wydano także Raport Taylora, który miał poprawić bezpieczeństwo na stadionach poprzez usunięcie z nich miejsc stojących[6].\r\n\r\nPieniądze telewizyjne stały się ważniejsze; Football League otrzymało 6,3 milionów funtów za dwuletnią umowę
      podpisaną w 1986 roku, zaś gdy w 1988 roku zawarto nowy, czteroletni kontrakt, kwota ta wynosiła 44 miliony[7]. W 1988 roku pierwszy raz spróbowano oddzielić First Division od Football League, jednak nie powiodło się to[8]. Stadiony rozbudowywano, coraz
      więcej osób przychodziło na spotkania; najlepsze kluby z Anglii ponownie rozpoczęły starania o powstanie nowych rozgrywek, niezależnych od Football League.","strDescriptionIL":"ע\"א פרמייר ליג (The FA Premier League) נגד המועצה להסדר ההימורים בספורט[1]
      הוא פסק דין של בית המשפט העליון שניתן בשנת 2010. עיקר המחלוקת נסובה סביב רצונן של ליגות הכדורגל בבריטניה לנכס לעצמן את זכות היוצרים בלוחות משחקים שהוכנו עבור הטורנירים שמתבצעים בליגות האנגליות והסקוטיות. כלומר, לנכס לעצמן את היכולות להשתמש ולאפשר שימוש
      באותם הלוחות שבהכנתם הושקעו משאבים רבים. בבואו להכריע את הדין, ביקש בית המשפט לאזן בין האינטרסים העומדים בבסיס דיני זכויות היוצרים, בעיקר בין האינטרס לתמרץ יוצרים כדי לעודד יצירה ובכך להעשיר את עולם הביטוי ובין הזכות לחופש המידע. פסק הדין מהווה חיזוק להלכות
      בית המשפט בעניין דרישת המקוריות שבחוק זכות יוצרים וכן למבחנים המשפטיים שנועדו לקבוע קנה מידה בנוגע לטיב המקוריות הנדרשת. השופט סלים ג''ובראן, בהסכמתם של השופטים ניל הנדל ומרים נאור, קבע שלוחות המשחקים אינם מהווים יצירה מקורית ולפיכך לא חוסים תחת הגנת זכות

      (Catalan: Trofeu Joan Gamper) or Joan Gamper Cup is an annual friendly football match held in August, before the start of FC Barcelona''s La Liga season. The competition is hosted by FC Barcelona at the Camp Nou stadium and is named in honour of Joan Gamper,
      a founding member, player, and later president of the club. The competition was inaugurated in 1966 by Enric Llaudet, one of Gamper''s successors as club president. The trophy itself is an 800 grams (1.8 lb) silver cup with five micrometres of gold finishing,
      on top of a 10 kilograms (22 lb) marble plinth base.\r\n\r\nInitially, four teams participated in the competition, which featured two semi-finals, a third-place play-off, and a final. For the first competition in 1966, Barcelona were joined by Belgium''s
      R.S.C. Anderlecht, France''s FC Nantes, and Germany''s FC Köln. Barcelona beat the German team 3–1 in the final. Köln subsequently won the competition in 1978 and 1981 and were runners-up in 1979, making them the only team, other than the hosts, to win
      the competition more than once. The next edition saw the first appearance of another Spanish team, Atlético Madrid, who along with the hosts, were joined by German side Bayern Munich, and Argentina''s Boca Juniors. The latter two clubs are among the most
      regular guests. Bayern were runners-up in 1984, 1987 and 2006, while Boca became the first of several South American guests to be invited and have since returned in 1977, 1984, 2003, 2008 and 2018. The only non-European team to win the tournament was Brazil''s

      explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home ground of Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley), the club bought an industrial
      and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later they won the council''s approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal''s history\" since the board appointed Herbert
      Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates Airline was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. Work was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million.","strStadiumLocation":"Holloway,

      Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the League and FA Cup Double, in the 1970–71 season, and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles and reached the 2006 UEFA Champions
      League Final. Since neighbouring Tottenham Hotspur, the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the North London derby.\r\n\r\nArsenal have one of the highest incomes and largest fanbases in the world. The club was named the fifth most valuable association
      football club in the world, valued at £1.3 billion in 2014.","strDescriptionDE":"Der FC Arsenal (offiziell: Arsenal Football Club) – auch bekannt als (The) Arsenal, (The) Gunners (deutsche Übersetzung: „Schützen“ oder „Kanoniere“) oder im deutschen Sprachraum

      über 40 Jahre nach der Gründung gewann Arsenal mit fünf Ligatiteln und zwei FA Cups in den 1930er Jahren seine ersten bedeutenden Titel. Der nächste Meilenstein war in der Saison 1970\/71 der Gewinn des zweiten englischen „Doubles“ im 20. Jahrhundert.
      In den vergangenen 20 Jahren etablierte sich Arsenal endgültig als einer der erfolgreichsten englischen Fußballvereine, und beim Gewinn zweier weiterer Doubles zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts blieb die Mannschaft in der Ligasaison 2003\/04 als zweite in

      Football Club, noto semplicemente come Arsenal, è una società calcistica inglese con sede a Londra, più precisamente nel quartiere di Holloway, nel borgo di Islington.[3]\r\n\r\nFondato nel 1886, è uno dei quattordici club che rappresentano la città di
      Londra a livello professionistico,[4] nonché uno dei più antichi del Paese. Milita nella massima serie del calcio inglese ininterrottamente dal 1919-1920, risultando quindi la squadra da più tempo presente in First Division\/Premier League. È la prima
      squadra della capitale del Regno Unito per successi sportivi e, in ambito federale, la terza dopo Manchester United e Liverpool, essendosi aggiudicata nel corso della sua storia tredici campionati inglesi, dodici FA Cup (record di vittorie, condiviso con
      il Manchester United), due League Cup e quattordici Community Shield (una condivisa),[5] mentre in ambito internazionale ha conquistato una Coppa delle Coppe ed una Coppa delle Fiere. Inoltre è una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di
      tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno
      subìto variazioni più o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni. Anche la sede del club è stata cambiata più volte: inizialmente la squadra giocava a Woolwich, ma nel 1913 si spostò all''Arsenal Stadium, nel quartiere di Highbury; dal 2006 disputa invece le
      sue partite casalinghe nel nuovo Emirates Stadium. Lo stemma è stato modificato ripetutamente, ma al suo interno è sempre comparso almeno un cannone. Proprio per questo motivo i giocatori ed i tifosi dell''Arsenal sono spesso soprannominati Gunners (in
      italiano \"cannonieri\").\r\n\r\nL''Arsenal conta su una schiera di tifosi molto nutrita, distribuita in ogni parte del mondo. Nel corso degli anni sono sorte profonde rivalità con i sostenitori di club concittadini, la più sentita delle quali è quella
      con i seguaci del Tottenham Hotspur, con i quali i Gunners giocano regolarmente il North London derby.[7] L''Arsenal è anche uno dei club più ricchi del mondo, con un patrimonio stimato di 1,3 miliardi di dollari, secondo la rivista Forbes nel 2014, facendone
      il quinto club più ricco del pianeta e il secondo in Inghilterra.[8]","strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/a1af2i1557005128.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133604-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/q2mxlz1512644512.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xyusxr1419347566.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qttspr1419347612.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uwssqx1420884450.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qtprsw1420884964.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/rtpsrr1419351049.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/ArsenalTour","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The club played at several grounds in its early history, before moving to a permanent location at Vicarage Road in 1922, where it remains to this day. Watford spent most of
      the following half century in the lower divisions of The Football League, changing colours and crest on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nEngland manager Graham Taylor saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylor''s appointment in 1977 and departure in 1987,
      Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team finished second in the First Division in the 1982–83 season, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983–84, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final. Watford experienced a decade of decline between
      1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League. The club''s most recent stint in the top division of English football was during the 2006–07 season,
      under Aidy Boothroyd''s management. In the 2014–15 season, Watford will compete in the Football League Championship – the second highest level of English football.\r\n\r\nWatford is currently owned by the Pozzo family, which also owns Udinese Calcio in
      Italy and Granada CF in Spain. Sir Elton John, who owned Watford during both of Graham Taylor''s successful periods as manager, served alongside Taylor as the club''s joint Honorary Life President, until 2008  only to later resume the role which he now

      situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road
      Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.\r\n\r\nBefore 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter
      of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league
      and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners'' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was unavailable due to it staging the final of the Olympic football tournament.","strStadiumLocation":"Aston,

      adjacent to it. The project was first conceived in 2007 and announced in 2008, but the plan was revised several times, and the construction of the stadium, beset by disputes and delays, did not commence until 2015. The stadium is due to be completed during
      the 2018–19 season. The stadium is scheduled to open in 2019, with a ceremony before the first competitive game.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\" is a temporary name, the intention being to sell the naming rights to the stadium, so that it
      will be named after a sponsor. The stadium is occasionally referred to as New White Hart Lane by fans and some in the media.","strStadiumLocation":"Bill Nicholson Way, Tottenham, London","intStadiumCapacity":"36284","strWebsite":"www.tottenhamhotspur.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/TottenhamHotspur","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/spursofficial","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/spursofficial","strDescriptionEN":"Tottenham
      Hotspur Football Club \/ˈtɒt(ə)nəm\/, commonly referred to as Spurs, is an English football club located in Tottenham, London, that plays in the Premier League. The club''s home stadium is White Hart Lane. Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls
      Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first
      club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup
      Winners'' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European
      trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy
      in each of the last six decades – an achievement only matched by Manchester United.\r\n\r\nThe club''s Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: \"To Dare Is to Do\"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry
      with nearby neighbours Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rxxqtp1448813512.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133616-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/fdjeb51559728043.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xpsuyq1420428497.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ywppvr1420509152.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tuuwpy1424110617.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xywqqs1421078139.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/uqxurt1423693152.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/spursofficial","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, England. It has been the home ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club since 1889, and has a long and illustrious history as the first ''new build'' stadium in Football League history, one of the first grounds in
      the country to install floodlights, as well as hosting some of the first European club games in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though
      it has since been eclipsed by many other ground developments. The stadium has however hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Although currently a 31,000 seater stadium,
      the record attendance at Molineux stands at 61,315.\r\n\r\nInitial plans were announced in May 2010 to rebuild two sides of the stadium by the 2014–15 season to increase capacity to around 36,000. The first stage of this project began in Summer 2011 and
      was completed on course for the start of the 2012–13 season.

      Wanderers Football Club Listeni\/ˌwʊlvərˈhæmptən\/ (commonly referred to as Wolves) is an English professional football club that represents the city of Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The club was originally known as St. Luke''s FC and was founded
      in 1877 and since 1889 has played at Molineux. They currently compete in the Football League Championship, the second highest tier of English football, having been promoted from League One in 2014 after a solitary season at that level.\r\n\r\nHistorically,
      Wolves have been highly influential, most notably as being founder members of the Football League, as well as having played an instrumental role in the establishment of the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League. Having won the FA Cup
      twice before the outbreak of the First World War, they developed into one of England''s leading clubs under the management of ex-player Stan Cullis after the Second World War, going on to win the league three times and the FA Cup twice more between 1949
      and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves \"Champions of the World\" following their victories against numerous top European and World sides in some of British football''s
      first live televised games.\r\n\r\nWolves have yet to match the successes of the Stan Cullis era, although, under Bill McGarry, they contested the first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1972 and won the 1974 League Cup, a trophy they lifted again six years later
      under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club''s very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham Turner and record goalscorer
      Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qwvuqy1448811552.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133599-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/wdes121532295945.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/p2xn8q1532295468.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kzx8521532295383.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3zzmow1532295430.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/co1ppu1532295499.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vyxrss1462380950.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialwolvesvideo","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is the home of Sheffield United. As the largest stadium in Sheffield during the 19th century it hosted most of the city''s most significant matches including the final of the world''s first football tournament,
      first floodlit match and several matches between the Sheffield and London Football Associations that led to the unification of their respective rules. It was also used by Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield F.C. for major matches. It has been the home of
      Sheffield United since the club''s establishment in 1889. It is the oldest major stadium in the world still to be hosting professional association football matches.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built on a Sheffield road named after the Bramall family (who were
      file and graver manufacturers). The Bramalls owned \"The Old White House\" on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street, and subsequently built the Sheaf House, now a public house that still stands at the top of Bramall Lane. The stadium was originally
      opened as a cricket ground. It was also used for football games in the 19th century by Sheffield F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday but since 1889 it has been the home of Sheffield United.\r\n\r\nBramall Lane is one of only two grounds (the other being the Oval)

      1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an
      international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted
      two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the stadium''s first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later
      by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing the first game under the new set of bulbs – a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was

      Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football.
      The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this
      was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club''s initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and
      played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four
      seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching
      the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with
      claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between
      1989–91 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990–1991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were
      relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the
      end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal
      Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home
      games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they have
      contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club''s kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year
      is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club''s longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club''s top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer
      fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rytxyw1448813222.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133632-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/woip371509012248.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/svsvqv1424367005.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3trd0z1547482101.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/yvuwup1424367035.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ryuspy1424367053.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vpvqyu1424562192.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWB9N0012fG6bGyj486Qxmg","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}'

      a multi-purpose stadium, with its primary tenant becoming West Ham United F.C.\r\n\r\nLand preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first public event in March 2012, serving
      as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial,
